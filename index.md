# Video Games – Group Project

Video games are one of the most influential and rapidly growing forms of entertainment in the world. They combine storytelling, creativity, strategy, and interactivity, offering players unique experiences that cannot be found in any other medium. From competitive shooters to open-world adventures, modern games continue to evolve in both technology and artistic depth.

This website presents three video games selected and described by members of our group. Each page includes detailed information, images, links, and a table with key facts about the game. Use the links below to visit each student's page.
